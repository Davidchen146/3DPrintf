# Introduction
Your OR-Tools files for 3DPrintf should go in this directory if you are running on Mac. It is recommended to install using the compiled binaries rather than building from source.

If you are building from source you may need to modify the CMake files. Please store copies in the CMakeLists references directory.

When building, OR-Tools cannot be built in debug mode. If you would like to use QTCreator's built-in debugger, you should use "Release with Debug Information" instead.

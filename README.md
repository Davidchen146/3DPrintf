# 3DPrintf

To build, you will need the following libraries:
- Libigl
- OR-Tools
- VCGLib
- Eigen

OR-Tools needs to be manually installed if you are using the compiled binaries (recommended). You should install OR-Tools in the OR-Tools directory for your OS (either `or-tools-windows` or `or-tools-mac`).
